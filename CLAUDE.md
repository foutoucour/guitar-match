# BMAD Project Template

## Intent Detection — Read This First

When the user sends a message **without a slash command**, default to `/ralph`. Ralph handles everything — from a vague description to a full backlog. This is the most common path.

**Exceptions** — override the Ralph default when the user's intent clearly matches one of these:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "go", "run it", "full workflow", "bmad" | Run `/bmad-run` |
| "where am I", "what's next", "status", "help", "dashboard" | Run `/bmad-help` |
| Asks about principles, standards, governance | If `.claude/output/principles.md` exists: **read and display it**. If not: run `/principles` to create it. |
| Questions requirements ("unclear", "what about", "edge case") | If `problem.yaml` exists: run `/clarify`. If not: run `/bmad-break`. |
| "Check specs", "ready to code?", "anything missing" | If all 3 artifacts exist: run `/analyze`. If no CRITICAL issues, then run `/checklist`. If artifacts missing: say which phases to run. |
| "debate", "discuss", "opinions on", "argue" | Run `/party` |
| "quick fix", "small feature", "just do", "fast track" | Run `/quick-spec` or `/quick-dev` depending on whether the user wants a spec or direct implementation |
| "brainstorm", "ideas for", "what if", "ideate" | Run `/brainstorm` |
| "split this doc", "shard", "break up this file" | Run `/shard` |
| "UX", "wireframe", "user flow", "screens", "user experience" | Run `/ux-spec` |
| "create agent", "new command", "new skill", "new rule" | Run `/create-component` |
| Asks for code review, test gen, security check | Run `/review`, `/test-gen`, or `/security-check`. |

**When the user uses a slash command** (`/bmad-break`, `/ralph`, etc.): follow that command exactly. The default-to-Ralph rule only applies when there is NO slash command.

## Workflow

- Full workflow: `/bmad-run` (Brainstorm → Principles → Break → Clarify → UX Spec → Model → Analyze → Checklist → GSD Prep → Act → Deliver)
- Individual phases: `/bmad-break`, `/bmad-model`, `/bmad-act`, `/bmad-deliver`
- Spec & quality: `/principles`, `/clarify`, `/analyze`, `/checklist`, `/ux-spec`
- Implementation: `/ralph`, `/ralph-loop`, `/gsd-prep`, `/quick-spec`, `/quick-dev`
- Ideation: `/brainstorm`, `/party`
- Utilities: `/shard`, `/create-component`, `/bmad-help`

## Eval Workflow

Skills and agents can be evaluated and optimized using the `ck` CLI:

1. **Eval**: `ck skill eval <skill-dir>` — test if the skill triggers correctly for a set of queries
2. **Optimize**: `ck skill optimize <skill-dir>` — iteratively improve the skill description via eval→improve loop
3. **Grade**: `ck skill grade <skill-dir> --output-file <file>` — evaluate output quality against assertions
4. **Benchmark**: `ck skill benchmark <results-dir>` — aggregate stats and compare runs
5. **Report**: `ck skill report <results.json>` — generate interactive HTML report

Eval sets are defined in `evals.json` files co-located with each skill's `SKILL.md`.

## Approach Selection

For any non-trivial implementation (new feature, infra change, refactor):
1. **Scan first**: read how similar things are done in the codebase before deciding on an approach
2. **Propose before implementing**: if there are multiple valid approaches, present 2-3 options with their tradeoffs and wait for the user to choose — do not pick one silently
3. **Prefer existing over new**: reuse existing patterns, modules, and dependencies before introducing new abstractions or tools
4. **Targeted over broad**: when the user asks about a specific thing, answer that specific thing — do not expand scope unless explicitly asked

## Code Principles

All code produced by any agent or skill MUST follow these principles:

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): never duplicate logic; extract shared code into reusable functions, modules, or classes
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple): prefer the simplest solution that works; avoid unnecessary abstractions and complexity
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **Least invasive**: make the smallest change possible; do not refactor, rename, or reorganize code outside the scope of the task
- **No over-engineering**: do not add features, configurability, or abstractions that are not explicitly required
- **Separation of concerns**: keep business logic, data access, presentation, and infrastructure in distinct layers
- **Clean code**: descriptive naming, small functions, no dead code, no commented-out code, no magic numbers

## Docs Index

- Stack-specific guidance is in `.claude/docs-index.md` — **read it at session start** for framework conventions
- The docs-index is auto-generated by `ck docs` based on detected project dependencies
- Staleness metadata is in `.claude/.docs-meta.json` (dependency hash + timestamp)
- At session start, check if docs-index is stale: run `/ck-sync` or tell the user to run `ck docs --refresh`
- Prefer retrieval-led reasoning: read the docs-index before making framework-specific decisions

## Build & Test

- Adapt commands below to your stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Build: `npm run build` (or equivalent)
- Test: `npm test` (or equivalent)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (or equivalent)
- After modifying functions, run `/test-check` to verify test coverage and honesty

## Code Style

- Follow language/framework conventions of the project
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Name variables and functions descriptively
- Prefer composition over inheritance when possible
- See @.claude/rules/code-style.md for detailed rules

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- **All commit messages and PR titles/descriptions must be written in English** — no exceptions regardless of the project's spoken language
- Before pushing, verify the remote is configured: `git remote -v`
- Before committing, review staged files: `git diff --cached --name-only` — never include files outside the current story or task scope
- Run `/commit-msg` to generate commit messages from staged changes
- Run `/review` before merging PRs

## Security

- Never hardcode secrets in code or config files
- Run `/security-check` before releases
- Run `/pentest` for web application security validation
- See @.claude/rules/security.md for security rules

## Context Management

- When context usage reaches the threshold defined by `CONTEXT_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` (default: 75%), proactively run `/compact` to free up context space before continuing work.
- The threshold is configured in `.claude/settings.json` under `env.CONTEXT_COMPACT_THRESHOLD`.

## Architecture

- See `.claude/agents/` for available agent roles
- See `.claude/skills/` for available skills
- Output artifacts are written to `.claude/output/`
