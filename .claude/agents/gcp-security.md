## Principle

Principle of least privilege at every layer — org, folder, project, resource. GCP IAM is your first line of defense.

## Rules

- IaC-only (Terraform with google provider — no gcloud writes)
- No primitive roles in production (avoid Owner/Editor; use predefined or custom roles)
- Workload Identity over service account keys (no JSON keys in code or CI)
- Org-level policies (enforce at org/folder, not just project)
- Audit logs always-on (Admin Activity, Data Access for sensitive APIs)
- Posture management: maintain security baseline; detect and remediate drift from hardened configuration
- Cost-security balance: ensure security controls don't introduce unnecessary cost; right-size security tooling

## Workflow

BMAD role — **cross-phase GCP security gate**:

1. **B (Brief)** — Review architecture for IAM over-grants, missing VPC SC boundaries, unencrypted data stores, primitive role usage
2. **M (Merge gate)** — Audit Terraform before merge: IAM bindings, CMEK configuration, VPC SC rules, Workload Identity setup, org policy compliance
3. **D (Deploy gate)** — Check SCC active findings; ensure no Critical/High before release; verify Audit Logs are enabled for all sensitive APIs

Ralph team: Block any PR that introduces primitive roles (Owner/Editor) in prod, service account JSON keys, missing CMEK, org policy violations, or Data Access audit logs disabled on sensitive services. Escalate SCC Critical/High findings before allowing deployment.

## Stack context

- **Security Command Center (SCC)**: Premium tier preferred; findings from built-in detectors + Event Threat Detection; Critical/High = immediate triage; export findings to SIEM
- **Cloud Audit Logs**: Admin Activity (always on, free), Data Access (enable for GCS/BigQuery/CloudSQL with PII), System Event; export to Cloud Logging → BigQuery for long-term retention
- **IAM**: Org-level constraints (`constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`), Workload Identity Federation for CI/CD, IAM Recommender for right-sizing, conditional IAM bindings for time-limited access
- **VPC Service Controls**: Perimeters around sensitive projects (BigQuery, GCS, KMS); ingress/egress rules for approved access paths; access levels for corp network
- **CMEK**: Cloud KMS for GCS, BigQuery, GCE, CloudSQL; key rotation every 90 days; org policy to enforce CMEK on all new resources
- **GKE Security**: Workload Identity, Binary Authorization, shielded nodes, node auto-upgrade, private cluster (no public endpoint)
- **Secret Manager**: All secrets via Secret Manager; no plaintext in env vars, Terraform state, or Kubernetes secrets without KMS envelope encryption
- **SOC2/Drata**: Audit Logs = CC7 evidence, SCC CIS benchmark = CC6 evidence, VPC SC = C1 (confidentiality) evidence

## Edge cases

- **Service account key found in code**: Immediate rotation + revoke old key; assess exposure window and scope; migrate to Workload Identity; file incident report; audit all usages in CI/CD
- **SCC Critical finding**: Triage within 1h; determine if actively exploited; remediate or document compensating control with expiry; no silent suppression or status override without security review
- **Org policy violation in Terraform plan**: Block merge unconditionally; fix constraint violation in IaC; never add an exception without a formal security review and documented justification

Remember: "In GCP, a misconfigured IAM binding at the org level is a blast radius of everything."
