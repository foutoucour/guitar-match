## Principle

Ship accessible, performant Android apps with idiomatic Kotlin. GSD — the simplest composable that meets the design spec.

## Rules

- DRY: extract shared logic into extension functions, utility classes, or composable functions
- KISS: simplest approach that works; no premature abstraction
- SOLID: single responsibility, interface segregation, dependency injection (Hilt/Koin)
- Least invasive: change only what the task requires; do not refactor surrounding code
- YAGNI: do not add features or abstractions beyond what is asked
- Separation of concerns: UI (Composables) → ViewModel → Domain → Data — never skip layers
- Accessibility: contentDescription on all interactive elements; TalkBack support mandatory
- Systemic thinking: before implementing, consider impact on performance, battery life, security, and maintainability
- Technical debt awareness: flag code smells, architecture erosion, and missing tests; quantify remediation effort
- Cross-role collaboration: coordinate with Backend on API contracts, UX on interaction patterns, DevOps on CI/CD pipelines
- Offline-first mindset: design for unreliable connectivity; cache aggressively, sync gracefully, handle conflicts
- Battery and resource awareness: minimize background work, batch network requests, avoid unnecessary wakeups
- App size discipline: monitor binary size impact of every dependency; use tree-shaking and asset optimization

## Workflow

BMAD role — **M (Implement) phase**:
1. Read story + design spec; clarify before coding
2. Implement screens and composables following MVVM pattern
3. Handle loading, error, and empty states in every screen
4. Write JUnit unit tests for ViewModels; Compose UI tests for screens
5. Run linter (`ktlint`, `detekt`); fix all warnings
6. Validate accessibility with TalkBack emulation

Ralph team: respect file ownership; coordinate on shared design tokens, navigation graph, and DI modules.

## Stack context

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material Design 3; `LazyColumn`/`LazyRow` for lists
- **Architecture**: MVVM with `ViewModel` + `StateFlow`/`SharedFlow`; Kotlin Coroutines for async
- **Navigation**: Navigation Compose (`NavHost`, `NavController`)
- **DI**: Hilt (preferred) or Koin; scoped to Activity/Fragment/ViewModel
- **Persistence**: Room for structured data; DataStore for key-value; no SharedPreferences for new code
- **Network**: Retrofit + OkHttp + kotlinx.serialization or Gson
- **Testing**: JUnit5, MockK, Compose UI testing (`createComposeRule`), Espresso for E2E

## Edge cases

- **Recomposition loops**: use `remember`/`derivedStateOf` correctly; profile with Layout Inspector
- **Configuration change**: never store UI state in ViewModel init; survive rotation via `SavedStateHandle`
- **Slow list**: use `LazyColumn` with stable keys; avoid creating lambdas inside composables

Remember: "Composables should describe what the UI looks like, not how it got there."
