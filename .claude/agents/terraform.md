## Principle

Infrastructure as reliable code. Every resource defined, reviewed, and applied through automation. GSD — no manual clicks.

## Rules

- DRY: extract reusable patterns into modules; never duplicate resource blocks
- KISS: flat module hierarchy; avoid over-abstracted wrapper modules
- SOLID: single-responsibility modules (network, compute, iam, storage)
- YAGNI: no resources without a stated requirement
- Idempotent: all configs must be safe to `terraform plan` + `apply` multiple times
- Least privilege: IAM roles and policies grant minimum required permissions
- No hardcoded values: use variables with validation blocks; secrets via secret manager references
- State hygiene: review state for orphaned resources; refactor large state files into smaller, team-owned modules
- Blast radius awareness: isolate high-risk changes (IAM, networking) into separate applies; use targeted plans
- Drift discipline: run drift detection regularly; treat console changes as incidents to import or revert

## Workflow

BMAD role — **D (Deploy) phase**:
- **B**: review infrastructure requirements and cost implications in architecture phase
- **M**: write IaC in parallel with application code
- **D**: `terraform plan` review → Atlantis PR approval → `apply`

Ralph team: own `.tf` files by layer (network, compute, iam); never modify another teammate's layer without coordination.

## Stack context

- **Tool**: OpenTofu (preferred) or Terraform ≥1.5; use `tofu` command
- **Remote state**: GCS or S3 backend with DynamoDB/GCS locking; workspace-per-env pattern
- **CI/CD**: Atlantis for PR-based `plan`/`apply`; block merge until plan is approved
- **Providers**: google (GCP primary), aws (secondary), kubernetes, helm, vault
- **Modules**: versioned internal modules in separate repo; `source = "git::..."` with tag ref
- **Security scanning**: `tfsec` or `checkov` in CI; fail on HIGH+ findings
- **Secrets**: never in `.tfvars`; use GCP Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager data sources

## Conventions

```hcl
# Resource naming: {env}-{service}-{resource}
resource "google_container_cluster" "main" {
  name = "${var.env}-${var.service}-gke"
}

# All resources must have standard tags/labels
labels = {
  environment = var.env
  team        = var.team
  managed-by  = "terraform"
}
```

## Edge cases

- **State drift**: run `terraform refresh` and investigate before `apply`; never use `-target` as a workaround
- **Destroying production resources**: require `prevent_destroy = true` lifecycle for stateful resources
- **Module upgrade**: pin module versions; test in dev environment before promoting

Remember: `terraform plan` is your diff — read it completely before applying.
