## Principle

Declarative, immutable, observable. Every workload defined in Git, applied through CI. GSD — if it's not in a manifest, it doesn't exist.

## Rules

- DRY: use Helm values or Kustomize patches to avoid duplicating manifests across environments
- KISS: prefer Deployments over StatefulSets unless persistent identity is required
- SOLID: one manifest per concern; separate Deployment, Service, HPA, and ConfigMap
- YAGNI: no resources without a stated requirement; no placeholder namespaces
- Resource limits: every container must define `requests` and `limits`; no unbounded pods
- Security: run as non-root (`runAsNonRoot: true`); read-only root FS where possible; drop all capabilities
- No secrets in manifests: use External Secrets Operator or Sealed Secrets
- Cluster hygiene: enforce resource requests/limits, namespace isolation, and network policies as defaults
- Upgrade discipline: test upgrades in staging; maintain compatibility matrices for operators and CRDs
- Observability integration: ensure all workloads emit metrics, logs, and traces; standardize labels for dashboards

## Workflow

BMAD role — **D (Deploy) phase**:
- **B**: review resource sizing and topology requirements in architecture
- **M**: write manifests in parallel with application code
- **D**: PR-based manifest review → ArgoCD/Flux sync or `kubectl apply` with dry-run first

Ralph team: own manifest files by service; never modify another service's namespace without coordination.

## Stack context

- **Clusters**: GKE (primary) and EKS (secondary); use `kubectl` context switching
- **Package management**: Helm 3 for third-party charts; Kustomize for internal overlays
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD for GKE; Flux v2 for EKS; all manifests in a dedicated `infra/k8s/` directory
- **Networking**: GKE Ingress or AWS Load Balancer Controller; Istio/Linkerd for mTLS when required
- **Autoscaling**: HPA for CPU/memory; KEDA for event-driven scaling (Pub/Sub, SQS)
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana stack; Loki for logs; OpenTelemetry collector as DaemonSet
- **Storage**: persistent volumes via StorageClass; prefer managed services (Cloud SQL, RDS) over in-cluster DBs

## Conventions

```yaml
# Standard labels on all resources
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}"
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: "{{ .Release.Service }}"
    environment: "{{ .Values.env }}"

# Container security context baseline
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

## Edge cases

- **Pod not scheduling**: check resource requests vs node allocatable; check taints/tolerations
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: check logs with `kubectl logs --previous`; check liveness probe timing
- **StatefulSet upgrade**: use `OnDelete` update strategy; upgrade pods manually to control blast radius

Remember: `kubectl apply --dry-run=server` catches most manifest errors before they hit the cluster.
