## IaC-Only Changes

- **Never use cloud CLI commands (`gcloud`, `aws`, `az`, `kubectl`) to make infrastructure changes** — use Terraform, Helm, or the project's IaC tool instead
- CLI commands are allowed **read-only**: `gcloud ... describe`, `aws ... get`, `kubectl get` for investigation and diagnosis only
- If a fix requires a manual step, document it as a `TODO` comment in the IaC file and flag it to the user — do not apply it manually

## Infrastructure as Code

- Use variables and modules to avoid hardcoding values; every environment-specific value should be a variable
- Pin provider and module versions explicitly to avoid breaking changes
- Configure remote state backend with locking (S3+DynamoDB, GCS, Terraform Cloud)
- Run `terraform plan` in CI and require approval before `terraform apply`
- Use infrastructure testing tools (Terratest, Conftest, OPA) to validate policies before merge

## Network and IAM

- Use least-privilege IAM policies; avoid wildcard (`*`) permissions
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data stores
- Segment networks using VPCs and subnets: separate public-facing, application, and data tiers
- Restrict security groups to specific CIDR ranges and ports; never allow `0.0.0.0/0` to management ports

## Containers

- Use multi-stage Docker builds to minimize image size
- Run containers as non-root users; set `USER` directive in Dockerfile
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities in CI (Trivy, Grype) before pushing to registry
- Pin base image versions to a specific digest or tag — do not use `latest`

## Drift and Compliance

- Enable drift detection to catch out-of-band changes
- Treat all infrastructure changes as code: manual console changes must be imported or reverted
